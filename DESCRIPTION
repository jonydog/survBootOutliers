Description: This packages provides three methods to perform outlier detection in a survival contex. In total there are six methods provided, the first three methods are traditional residual-based outlier detection methods, the second three are the concordance-based. Package developed during the work on the following  publications: Pinto J., Carvalho A. and Vinga S. (2015). Outlier Detection in Survival Analysis based on the Concordance C-index.In Proceedings of the International Conference on Bioinformatics Models, Methods and Algorithms - Volume 1: BIOINFORMATICS, (BIOSTEC 2015) ISBN 978-989-758-070-3, pages 75-82.
